App for 2-in-1 Hackintosh to enable Tablet Mode
<br />
<br />
<br/>


Download Instructions:

2– Place KCT in Downloads Folder
3– Run KCT and allow Accessibility permissions
4– Check "Start cleaning immediately [...]"
4– Run TabletMode and grant Services permissions (it might do it automatically)

Notes: 1– Once activated, the internal AND virtual keyboards are disabled. I am working on a solution.

2– I couldn't find a way to hide the dialogue box to exit Tablet Mode so you might want to move it in a corner.

3– To close KCT, use the dialogue box.

4– As opposed to the dialog box, KCT can be minimized or hidden.

5– When running KCT, the trackpad is still usable for obvious reasons.
